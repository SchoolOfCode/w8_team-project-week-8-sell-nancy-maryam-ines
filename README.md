# w8_team-project-week-8-sell-nancy-maryam-ines

OUR PLAN

APIs (.js)
- Ines = text to text translator API
- Nancy = text to speech translator API
- Next steps: writing .js, adding APIs to repo and creating fetch requests, storing user input, button functionality between html and js

Design (HTML, CSS)
- Sellanni = designing website (homepage and contact us), altering template to match our needs
- Maryam = working on HTML (about us and features), 

Target audience research
- collate information surrounding target audience into a presentation
- include info such as colours, font, reasons for use of app, why this app is different

Presentation
- record information from all meetings (notes, wireframes, designs, colour schemes, api research etc)
- start putting together a presentation visualising step-by-step progess

## Presentation: Plan

- Plan your presentation, and bring the audience along the journey.
- All of your team should contribute to the presentation.
- Don't fill your slides with text! Tell the story yourselves, and use imagery and data to help paint the picture and emphasise the important points.
- A guideline structure for a project presentation could be:
  - Introduce the team.
  - Project: what APIs you chose and why?
  - LIVE Demo time: show off your solution.
  - Analysis: Give a summary of how the project went, or what value it delivered.
- Practice by running through the presentation a few times with your team if possible, especially the live demo and product walk-through.
